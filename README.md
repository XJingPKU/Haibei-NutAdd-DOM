**Abstract**  
Elevated atmospheric nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) deposition is increasingly altering soil dissolved organic matter (DOM) dynamics in terrestrial ecosystems, with potential implications for carbon cycling, nutrient availability, and ecosystem functionality. However, the long-term impacts of such deposition on DOM quantity and quality remain poorly understood, particularly with respect to indirect regulation by plant inputs and microbial decomposition. We investigated whether long-term N and P additions increase DOM quantity (i.e., dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and soil organic carbon (SOC)), and modify DOM quality—likely by promoting aromaticity and humification—through changes in plant-derived inputs and microbial processes. We performed a 14-year nutrient addition experiment in alpine grassland on the Tibetan Plateau, where we measured DOM quantity with an elemental analyzer and DOM quality with UV-Visible absorbance and three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix (3D-EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy. We found that P addition significantly decreased topsoil SOC by 16.8%, while N addition mitigated the negative effects of P addition (N × P interaction: p = 0.013, estimated coefficient = 0.62, 95%Cl: [0.13, 1.12]). Conversely, P addition enhanced DOM stability by increasing the humification index by 50.1%. N addition enhanced DOM complexity and aromaticity by increasing the biological index by 7.4% and SUVA254 by 63.2%. Our results suggest that N addition enhanced DOM complexity and aromaticity. This favors accumulation of microbial-derived, recalcitrant components. The mechanisms involve elevated electrical conductivity and selective suppression of cellulolytic enzyme activity. These changes promote qualitative carbon persistence. In contrast, P addition reduced DOM quantity. It does so via reduced root biomass inputs and moisture. At the same time, it boosts residual DOM stability. This occurs through enhanced humification. Our work underscores contrasting pathways through which long-term N and P additions affect topsoil DOM quantity and quality, potentially reshaping carbon cycling and ecosystem resilience in nutrient-enriched alpine grasslands.
